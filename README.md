I'm thrilled to share that I‚Äôve successfully completed my first task as a Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Intern at Brainwave Matrix Solutions!
For this task, I developed a Python-based Phishing Link Scanner that: üîç Detects suspicious and potentially malicious URLs

Key Features:
* URL Length Checker
 Flags URLs longer than 75 characters as potentially suspicious.
* HTTPS Verification
 Verifies if a URL uses HTTPS for secure communication.
* Phishing Keyword Detection
 Scans URLs for common phishing-related keywords like login, secure, verify, account, paypal, etc.
* Domain Age Checker (via WHOIS Lookup)
 Uses the whois module to:
 Parse domain from the URL
 Check the domain's creation date
 Classify domains younger than 180 days as suspicious
* Redirect Tracker
 Uses the requests module to detect if the URL performs excessive redirection, which is common in phishing attacks.

This project not only enhanced my Python programming skills but also deepened my understanding of real-world phishing detection techniques ‚Äî a crucial aspect of modern cybersecurity.
Grateful to my mentors and the entire Brainwave Matrix Solutions team for their invaluable support and guidance. Excited to take on the next challenges and continue growing in this journey! üöÄ
